To fix this, you need to ensure the state is properly initialized and handled within your component.  Here's a modified version using optional chaining and a default value:

```javascript
import React, { useState } from 'react';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <View>
      <Text>Count: {count ?? 0}</Text> {/* Use optional chaining and default value */}
      <Button title="Increment" onPress={() => setCount(count + 1)} />
    </View>
  );
};

export default MyComponent;
```

This approach uses the nullish coalescing operator (`??`) to provide a default value of 0 if `count` is null or undefined.  Alternatively, you could conditionally render content based on whether the state has been initialized.
